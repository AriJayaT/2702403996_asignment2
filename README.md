# Final Project Group Sample Webpage

This repository contains the code for the Week 3 Web Application Development (WADS) project. The project showcases a multi-page website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes several pages and assets that demonstrate various concepts such as technical specifications, air quality data visualization, and encryption-themed visuals.

## Project Overview

With rapid urbanization and industrialization, air pollution has become a major concern for both human health and the environment. Inspired by advanced air quality forecasting methods from recent research, this project provides a web-based interface to explore topics related to air quality monitoring and analysis. The website features:

- **Air Quality Dashboard:** Visual representation of air quality data (see `air_quality.png`).
- **Technical Specifications:** Detailed system and project specs (see `TechSpecs.png`).
- **Encryption & Security Concepts:** Visual cues related to encryption (see `encrypto.png`).
- **Team Member Profiles:** Individual pages (e.g., `ari.html`, `galih.html`, `wallace.html`) highlighting the contributions of each team member.

## File Structure
- index.html      --> Main landing page for the web application
- script.js       --> JavaScript file for dynamic interactions
- style.css       --> CSS file for styling the website
- ari.html        --> Profile page for Ari
- galih.html      --> Profile page for Galih
- wallace.html    --> Profile page for Wallace
- ari.png         --> Profile image for Ari
- galih.png       --> Profile image for Galih
- wallace.png     --> Profile image for Wallace
- TechSpecs.png   --> Image displaying technical specifications
- air_quality.png --> Image visualizing air quality data
- encrypto.png    --> Image related to encryption concepts


## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS3:** For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript:** For interactivity and dynamic content.
